## Exercise 4 - Create a markdown cell to list data science languages

Start the cell with an overview line such as:

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
Then create an ordered list (i.e. numbered) listing 3 (or more) commonly used languages for data science.

## Exercise 5 - Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries

Add an overview line to the cell like:

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
Below this line add an ordered list listing 3 (or more) commonly used libraries in data science.

## Exercise 6 - Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools

Create a single column table in this cell with the first row containing the header Data Science Tools. The subsequent three rows in the table should indicate three development environment open source tools used in data science.

## Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples

Add a line in this cell with H3 style heading with text like:

Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

## Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers


``` In this code cell evaluate the expression (3*4)+5.
Insert a comment line before the expression to explain the operation e.g.  This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers. 


Then execute the cell to ensure the expression returns the expected output of 17.
 
```

## Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours

In this code cell write an expression that converts 200 minutes into hours.
Insert a comment line before the expression to explain the operation e.g.  This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60.
Run the cell to evaluate the expression.

## Exercise 10 - Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives

Below the introduction cell created in Exercise 3, insert a new markdown cell to list the objectives that this notebook covered (i.e. some of the key takeaways from the course). In this new cell start with an introductory line titled: Objectives: in bold font. Then using an unordered list (bullets) indicate 3 to 5 items covered in this notebook, such as List popular languages for Data Science.
